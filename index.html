    <h2 class="center-title">About Me</h2>

    <div class="about-box">
        <p>
            I am a data science enthusiast with a growing interest in data analysis, machine learning, and algorithms. I enjoy working with real-world datasets to uncover patterns, extract insights, and build predictive models with proper evaluation.
        
            I have hands-on experience with Python, SQL, and core data science libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib. Through academic coursework and practical projects, I have worked on data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and performance evaluation.
        </p>

         <p>
            Alongside data science, I have a strong background in data structures and algorithms and experience developing applications in C, C++, and Java. These experiences have strengthened my problem-solving and analytical skills, and I am continuously learning to apply data science and machine learning techniques to real-world problems.
